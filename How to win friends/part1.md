# Fundamental Techniques in Handling People



## Principle 1 Don't criticize, condemn or complain

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return.

human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves.

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity

## Principle 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation

just one thing to get anybody to do anything is by making the other person want to do it.

the deepest urge in human nature is **"the desire to be important"**

people sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.

I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people

Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.

In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.

Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed

## Principle 3  Arouse in the other person an eager want

The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. 

if there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.

First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.
