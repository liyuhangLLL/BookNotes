# Six Ways to Make People Like you 

## Principle 1 Become genuinely interested in other people

You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

## Principle 2 Smile

There is one sure way to seek happiness, that is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.

The effect of a smile is powerful --even when it is unseen. Your "smile" comes through in your voice.

People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.

You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.

Force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force ourself to whistle or hum a tun or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.

## Principle 3 Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language

## Principle 4 Be a good listener & Encourage others to talk about themselves.

Listening is just as important in one's home life as in the world of business.

So  if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.

## Principle 5 Talk in terms of  the other person's interests.

The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the  things he or she treasures most.

## Principle 6 Make the other person feel important ——and do it sincerely.

The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.
