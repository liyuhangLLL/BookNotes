# Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment

## Principle 1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation

It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our goo points.



## Principle 2  Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly



## Principle 3  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person

It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.



## Principle 4  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders

He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them learn from their mistakes.

Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.



## Principle 5  Let the other person save the face

Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.

Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.



## Principle 6 Praise the slightest improvement and every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise"

Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it.

We all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.



## Principle 7 Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to

The average person can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability.

If you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.

Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.                                                                                                                            



## Principle 8 Use encouragement & Make the fault seem easy to correct.

## Principle 9 Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest

Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
