# How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking



## Principle 1 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

Nine times out ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.

But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego,he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.



## Principle 2 Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong"

If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it.

You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broadminded as you are.

When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.

Don't tell them they are wrong, don't get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.



## Principle 3 If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically

## Principle 4 Being in a  friendly way

A drop of  honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.

If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can't win him your way of thinking with all the logic.

## Principle 5 Get the other saying "yes, yes" immediately

It is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.

In talking with people, don't begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing -- and keep on emphasizing -- the things on which you agree.

## Principle 6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

Let the other people talk themselves out.

Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they-- or at least some of them -- will feel inferior and envious.
