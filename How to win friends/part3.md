# How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking



## Principle 1 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

Nine times out ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.

But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego,he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.



## Principle 2 Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong"

If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it.

You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broadminded as you are.

When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.

Don't tell them they are wrong, don't get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.



## Principle 3 If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically

## Principle 4 Being in a  friendly way

A drop of  honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.

If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can't win him your way of thinking with all the logic.

## Principle 5 Get the other saying "yes, yes" immediately

It is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.

In talking with people, don't begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing -- and keep on emphasizing -- the things on which you agree.

## Principle 6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

Let the other people talk themselves out.

Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they-- or at least some of them -- will feel inferior and envious.

## Principle 7 Let the other person feel that the idea is his or her

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas.

## Principle 8 Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.

Seeing things through another person's eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become overwhelming.

An increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person's point of view, and see things from that person's angle as well as your own.

## Principle 9 Be sympathetic with the other  person's ideas and desires.

Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathetic.

## Principle 10 Appeal to the nobler motives

The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.

But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.

People are honest and want to discharge their obligations.

## Principle 11 Dramatize your ideas

The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.

You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your life.

## Principle 12 Thrown down a challenge

The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. The desire to excel.

The one major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.

The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.
